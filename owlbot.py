### SUPPORT DATABASE PLUGINS ###

# known address. On Unix we spin up Docker containers to do so, while on Windows
# we disable plugin integration tests, as there is no known procedure for doing
# something equivalent.

### FIX CODE COVERAGE ###
# The Trace Agent has a custom script for generating code coverage (including
# custom nyc CLI params in lieu of .nycrc), which is necessary because its tests
# are not run in the same process (due to its monkeypatching nature).
# (It's possible that in the future, we adopt .nycrc, but only as a base
# configuration, as we need to specify a different reporting directory for each
# test.)
